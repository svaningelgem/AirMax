### Necessary libraries:
pip install pySqsListener sqlite3 dateutil Flask webbrowser

### Necessary setup:
You'll need the following environment variables:
```
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
```

You'll need the following files:
~/.aws/config
```
[default]
region=eu-west-1
```

~/.aws/credentials
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <access key>
aws_secret_access_key = <secret key>
```


### Running it
```
python start.py
```

This will start the SQS listener as well as the webserver.
Additionally it will open a web browser to the map interface.


### Configuration
As this is a PoC, I left a lot of stuff inside the code.
For example:
- listener: (extra) filtering on BE
- listener: saving of the messages inside the cache directory (json format)
- use of SQLite instead of rds/mysql/...
- webservice: debug values outputted because no real data within the previous 3h
- webservice: mid-point based on OpenAQ's map for several different parameters
- webservice: port 5000
- start: name of region & sqs message queue
